# Point Matching Method of Moments (PM_MoM)

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of the Point Matching Method of Moments for microstrip line analysis. The Point Matching method uses rectangular pulse basis functions with point testing to solve electromagnetic problems.

## Features
- **Point Matching Implementation**: Uses point testing with rectangular pulse basis functions
- **Convergence Analysis**: Detailed analysis of convergence with increasing N values
- **Empirical Comparison**: Comparison with empirical formulas from Notaros textbook
- **Surface Charge Distribution**: Visualization of charge distribution patterns
- **High-Resolution Analysis**: Non-uniform segmentation for better accuracy
